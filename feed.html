        <article>Welcome to my project page! My name is Meagan Price. I'm a student of Web Design and Development at Full Sail University. I was born and raised in Florida. I decided to go into Web Design after spending countless hours editing my own codes for social media. Here I will be showing some of my favorite design components that I have found for my Web Standards Project class. The link to the blog posts about each are below. Thank you for taking the time to visit!</article>
        <p>Any Questions or feedback are welcome!<br>

    <div id="post_title"><h2>Info feed:</h2></div>

    <div id="feed">
        <img id="comp_img" src="img/Component_Feed.png"><br>

        <p>Although this component isn't actually used as a blog feed on this site, I though this, or a similar concept, would make an awesome way to display a blog archive to users. By switching out some of the imgs on the line with link to different blog post or imgs, I think this would be a fun way to make a blog feed.</p>

        <h3 id="visual">Visualization:</h3>

        <p>This particular component consists of multiple [div] sections, with [img] to the left or the right signifying a new section. Each section has a brief [p] section describing it.</p>
