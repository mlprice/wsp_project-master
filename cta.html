        <article>Welcome to my project page! My name is Meagan Price. I'm a student of Web Design and Development at Full Sail University. I was born and raised in Florida. I decided to go into Web Design after spending countless hours editing my own codes for social media. Here I will be showing some of my favorite design components that I have found for my Web Standards Project class. The link to the blog posts about each are below. Thank you for taking the time to visit!</article>
        <p>Any Questions or feedback are welcome!<br>

    <div id="post_title"><h2>The Clear Call</h2></div>

    <div id="feed">
        <img id="comp_img" src="img/Component_CTA.png"><br>

        <p>This CTA can be found directly under this site's header and navigation. The component is simple, a clear call to action, persuading the user that staying in this particular hotel will be enjoyable.</p>

        <h3 id="visual">Visualization:</h3>

        <p>The component probably consists of a [div] with an [img]. You can see below the call three scrolling indicators. </p>
