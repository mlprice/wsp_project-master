        <article>Welcome to my project page! My name is Meagan Price. I'm a student of Web Design and Development at Full Sail University. I was born and raised in Florida. I decided to go into Web Design after spending countless hours editing my own codes for social media. Here I will be showing some of my favorite design components that I have found for my Web Standards Project class. The link to the blog posts about each are below. Thank you for taking the time to visit!</article>
        <p>Any Questions or feedback are welcome!<br>

        <p>The navigation of this website is done through a simple bar navigation, that is custom styled for this particular company. The nav features a drop down menu, indicated my the small arrow next to the section that contains it. Users can move throughout the site by clicking on each section or the link within the drop down menu of a section.</p>

        <h3 id="visual">Visualization:</h3>

       <p> The component consists of a [div] and a styled [ul], containing linked list items ([li], and [a]). The component also features a nested [ul] with more [li] and [a] elements. </p>
