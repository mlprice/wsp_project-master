    <div id="intro" ><h2>Hello!</h2>
        <article>Welcome to my project page! My name is Meagan Price. I'm a student of Web Design and Development at Full Sail University. I was born and raised in Florida. I decided to go into Web Design after spending countless hours editing my own codes for social media. Here I will be showing some of my favorite design components that I have found for my Web Standards Project class. The link to the blog posts about each are below. Thank you for taking the time to visit!</article>
        <p>Any Questions or feedback are welcome!<br>

    <div id="post_title"><h2>My Featured Component:</h2></div>

    <div id="feed">
        <img id="comp_img" src="img/Component_About.png"><br>

        <p>The component I chose as my featured web design component is the "about us" component. To view the post about this, <a href="about.html">click here!</a> </p>

        <h3 id="visual">Visualization:</h3>

        <p> The component consists of a [div] section under another [div]. The "about us" probably includes some form of [article] or [p] tag to display the text, with a [button] and a link [a] tag to invite the user to learn more about the company.</p><br><br>

        <p> To add to the previous, this "about us" looks to utilize CSS's column feature, in which the developer can add columns to style a chunk of [p] paragragph. The font size looks to be very similar to the typical 12 pt. font, in a sans-serif font that is easy to read on computer or mobile displays.</p>
