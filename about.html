        <article>Welcome to my project page! My name is Meagan Price. I'm a student of Web Design and Development at Full Sail University. I was born and raised in Florida. I decided to go into Web Design after spending countless hours editing my own codes for social media. Here I will be showing some of my favorite design components that I have found for my Web Standards Project class. The link to the blog posts about each are below. Thank you for taking the time to visit!</article>
        <p>Any Questions or feedback are welcome!<br>

    <div id="feed">
        <img id="comp_img" src="img/Component_About.png"><br>

        <p>I love this about section. It's found just under the site/company's name, which is overlayed on an img of the product they specialize with. How fun is that? The about sections features a brief paragraph about the company. It also invites the user to learn even more about the company.</p>

        <h3 id="visual">Visualization:</h3>

        <p> The component consists of a [div] section under another [div]. The "about us" probably includes some form of [article] or [p] tag to display the text, with a [button] and a link [a] tag to invite the user to learn more about the company.</p>
