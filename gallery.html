    <div id="intro" ><h2>Hello!</h2>
        <article>Welcome to my project page! My name is Meagan Price. I'm a student of Web Design and Development at Full Sail University. I was born and raised in Florida. I decided to go into Web Design after spending countless hours editing my own codes for social media. Here I will be showing some of my favorite design components that I have found for my Web Standards Project class. The link to the blog posts about each are below. Thank you for taking the time to visit!</article>
        <p>Any Questions or feedback are welcome!<br>

    <div id="post_title"><h2>Comments on the (photo) gallery:</h2></div>

    <div id="feed">
        <img id="comp_img" src="img/Component_Gallery.png"><br>

        <p>This component is a beautifully done photo gallery featured on the site's front page. This site is used as a photographers portfolio, making the display of the photos a top priority. This photo gallery allows the user to view the photo right there on the front page, as well as scrolling through alternate photos in a bar below the larger displayed picture.</p>

        <h3 id="visual">Visualization:</h3>

        <p>The component is comprised of, most importantly, the [img] that make up the gallery. The gallery itself is probably nested in a [div], each [img] has an alternate thumbnail [img] displayed in a bar at the bottom that links [a] to the larger [img], or at least triggers a javascript event to display the larger [img] in the [div].</p>
